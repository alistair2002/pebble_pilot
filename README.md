# pebble_pilot
pebble software for use with hm10 pilot and in turn freeboard

This is a very basic pebble app, I am sure you could make them complicated if you want.  But it mostly acts as a remote control for the phone running the
android app which is also in here somewhere.

My requirement was to avoid slipping, tripping and dropping the phone.  Also the benefits of the pebble as sun readable as always on.

NB the polycarbon cover isn't polarised sunglasses friendly.

I think the app has to be paged in ??
